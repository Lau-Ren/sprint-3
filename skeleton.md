<h5> What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?</h5>
<br>
<p>The html elements appear to stack on top of each other as the screen size gets smaller. 
<br>Skeleton uses a mobile first design, this means that the the smaller screen layout is the orignal design and larger screens are targeted with media queries. As the the screen size increases media quries apply additional CSS.  </p>
